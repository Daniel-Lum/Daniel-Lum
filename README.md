Hello,

My name is Daniel and I'm here to learn/share some new skills. I enjoy learning new things and would consider myself an efficiency junkie.  

My interests outside of the office include sports (Giants, Warriors, 49ers, fantasy football), Hiking, board/video games, finance, food and the outdoors.

I hope to add projects regularly. Feel free to reach out with any questions or friendly words. 👍 

Best Regards,
Daniel Lum
